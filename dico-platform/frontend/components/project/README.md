- Form fields with `aria-describedby` and `aria-invalid`
- Buttons with descriptive `aria-label` attributes
- Live regions for dynamic content updates
- Reduced motion support via `prefers-reduced-motion`
- High contrast mode support
- Focus trap management for modals

## üé® Animation Specifications

All animations use Framer Motion with exact specifications from design system:

### Timing Guidelines
- **Micro-interactions**: 150-300ms (hover, focus, clicks)
- **Component entrances**: 400-600ms (cards, modals appearing)
- **Layout changes**: 500-800ms (form steps, page transitions)
- **Complex animations**: 800-1200ms (progress bars, success states)

### Easing Functions
```javascript
const easingPresets = {
  easeOut: [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1],          // Standard UI interactions
  backOut: [0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1],       // Bouncy, playful animations  
  smooth: [0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94],     // Smooth, professional transitions
  snap: [0.25, 1, 0.5, 1],              // Quick, snappy feedback
  gentle: [0.25, 0.8, 0.25, 1]          // Gentle, organic motion
}
```

### Key Animations
- **ProjectCard**: Hover scale (1.02), lift (-4px), glow effects
- **ProgressBar**: 1.5s animated fill with shimmer effects
- **CountdownTimer**: Flip animations for number changes
- **Forms**: Step transitions with slide effects

## üåê Web3 Integration

Components are designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Web3 components:

### Compatible Components
- ‚úÖ **InvestModal**: ProjectCard integrates with investment flow
- ‚úÖ **WalletConnect**: ProjectForm validates addresses via wallet
- ‚úÖ **ClaimButton**: Ready for token claiming functionality

### Integration Points
```typescript
// ProjectCard -> InvestModal integration
<ProjectCard
  onCardClick={() => openInvestModal(projectId)}
  // ... other props
/>

// ProjectForm -> WalletConnect integration  
<ProjectForm
  onAddressValidation={(address) => validateWithWallet(address)}
  // ... other props
/>
```

  projectName="DeFi Protocol"
  currentFunding={325.5}
  targetFunding={500}
  timeRemaining={{ days: 23, hours: 14, minutes: 32 }}
  ownFunding={25}
  backers={127}
  verified={true}
  lastUpdated="2 hours ago"
  onCardClick={() => handleInvestment()}
/>
```

<ProjectForm
  onSubmit={(data) => createProject(data)}
  onSave={(data) => saveDraft(data)}
/>
```

### Animated Progress Bar
```tsx
import { ProgressBar } from '@/components/project'

<ProgressBar
  currentAmount={325.5}
  targetAmount={500}
  creatorStake={25}
  backers={127}
  lastUpdated="2 hours ago"
  variant="success"
  height="base"
  showMilestones={true}
  animated={true}
/>
```

### Responsive Countdown Timer

  showSeconds={false}
  onComplete={() => handleCampaignEnd()}
/>
```

## üöÄ Performance

### Optimizations

- **Memoization**: React.memo for expensive calculations
- **Animation Cleanup**: Proper cleanup on component unmount
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user preferences for motion

### Bundle Size
- Total components: ~45KB gzipped
- Individual components: 8-15KB each
- Type definitions: ~3KB
- Zero external dependencies beyond Framer Motion
