## How Agent Workflows Work:

Agents collaborate using this syntax:

> First use the [agent-name] to [task], then use the [agent-name] to [next task]

## Requirements:

1. I'll give you an app idea (which includes the tech stack), and YOU must:

   - Define the exact features and scope

   - Design an appropriate file structure for agent context sharing

   - Create a 4-phase development workflow

2. The phases should follow this pattern:

   - Phase 1: UX & Planning

   - Phase 2: UI Design

   - Phase 3: Frontend Development

   - Phase 4: Backend Development

3. Key Constraints:

   - UX agent only decides positioning/layout of YOUR defined features

   - Each agent must save outputs and read from previous agents

   - Agents need clear handoff instructions

   - Include polished UI and micro-interactions

   - No web search allowed

## My App Idea (pt-br):

Dico (Decentralized ICO)

Idéia:
Dico é um dapp (decentralized app) onde é possível realizar um ICO (Initial Coin Offering) de forma totalmente pública e descentralizada. Usuários podem travar dinheiro nesse projeto e se o valor alvo de arrecadação for atingido, o Public ICO cria o contrato inteligente, faz a distribuição dos tokens para os investidores e move os fundos arrecadados para uma carteira publica que é cadastrada na criação do projeto.

Como funciona:

1. Primeiramente o criador do projeto sobe seu projeto no Public ICO, contendo:

- O link do white paper que explica a idéia do seu projeto.
- O link de um plano de projeto, onde ele explica como se dará os gastos com desenvolvimento, manutenção, marketing, tokenomics e tudo que um investidor precisa entender para investir no seu projeto.
- O código do contrato inteligente que iniciará o projeto.
- Um valor em eth que será travado pelo criador, de modo que ele tenha skin in the game.
- O valor alvo de arrecadação para o projeto.
- Um endereço de carteira onde serão transferidos os valores arrecadados, se o alvo for atingido.

\*\*O tempo de expiração do projeto será de 3 meses fixo.

2. Usuários irão poder visualizar os projetos ativos e travar eth no projeto que lhe agradar.

3. Se após a expiração do projeto, o valor não for atingido, os usuários que travaram eth no projeto, poderão realizar o claim dos valores travados.

4. Se o valor alvo for atingido ou ultrapassado, o criador do projeto poderá fazer o Apply do projeto, que fará:

- A criação do contrato inteligente mediante o código fornecido pelo criador do projeto.
- Mover os fundos travados do projeto para uma carteira definida no momento da criação do projeto.

Detalhes técnicos:

1. Dados do projeto:
   — Link do White Paper
   — Código do Contrato Inteligente
   — Link do Plano de Projeto
   — Tokenomics
   — Own Funding (valor em eth travado pelo criador do projeto)
   — Target Funding (valor alvo em eth a ser arrecadado)
   — Address Funding (endereço de carteira que serão transferidos os fundos, se atingir o valor alvo)
   — Deadline (limite de 3 meses fixo)

2. Funções do contrato inteligente do Public ICO:

- Função para armazenar o projeto.
- Função para listar os projetos ativos (que não estão expirados).
- Função que possibilita usuários a travarem eth no projeto escolhido.
- Função que possibilita os usuários a darem claim nos valores que eles travaram.
- Função que possibilita o criador do projeto a dar o Apply (se o valor alvo foi atingido e o projeto está ativo).

\*\* No Apply a função deve criar o contrato inteligente e mover os fundos travados para o Address Funding.

## What I Need From You:

1. Analyze the app idea and define:

   - EXACT features to be built (detailed scope)

   - Tech stack confirmation

   - Appropriate file structure for this project

2. Create an initial setup prompt for the file structure you design

3. Generate detailed prompts for each phase that include:

   - Which agents to use and in what order

   - Exactly what each agent should build (based on your scope)

   - Where to save their outputs

   - Where to read previous outputs

   - How to update handoff documentation

Make sure to lock the scope - agents should not add features beyond what you define. Give explicit instructions for file management and agent collaboration.
